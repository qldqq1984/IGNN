# Intratumor graph neural network recovers hidden prognostic value of multi-biomarker spatial heterogeneity
IGNN (IGNNE) is a graph neural network-based interpretable machine learning model for recovering hidden prognostic value from the recently reported tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS1-8) observed in MPM imaging. For more details, see the acompanying paper.
